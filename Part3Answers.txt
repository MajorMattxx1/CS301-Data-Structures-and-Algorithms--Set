1.What is the advantages/disadvantages of a tree approach rather than a hash based approach?

The advantages of a tree approach is organization, quick runtime with low number of nodes, and perhaps relative ease of use.

Disadvantages for trees is low access time, increasing inefficiency with increasing number of nodes, and relatively large data use per element. 

Hash based can instantly access any desired element, and handles large amount of data in a simpler manner with less overhead.

2. Average big O of following methods based on my (not entirely functional) methods:
add - constant, after an if/else, it slaps the elem into the bucket
remove - n, it looks for the elem, and deletes if found
contains - n, somewhat like remove, minus the deleting part
for the next three, to quote cplusplus.com:
"Up to linear in 2*(count1+count2)-1
(where countX is the distance between firstX and lastX):
Compares and assigns elements."
intersection - n^2, there's a loop inside a loop
difference - n^2, same reasoning as above
union - n^2, same reasoning as above
